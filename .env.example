# Upstash Redis Configuration
# Get these values from your Upstash Redis console at https://console.upstash.com/

# The app works in two modes:
# 1. Demo Mode (No configuration): Data stored temporarily in memory
# 2. Production Mode (With Upstash Redis): Data persisted in Redis

# To enable Production Mode:
# 1. Create an Upstash Redis database at https://console.upstash.com/
# 2. Copy the connection details to your .env file
# 3. Deploy to Vercel with these environment variables
# 4. Done! Your data will be persisted in Upstash Redis

# Note: For local development, create a .env file with your Upstash credentials
